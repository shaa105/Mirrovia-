# Mirrovia
This project explores the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Augmented Reality (AR) to build MIRROVIA—a revolutionary fashion advisory system that delivers personalized styling recommendations and enhanced user experiences in real time. Designed with a strong commitment to inclusivity and accessibility, MIRROVIA bridges the gap between digital fashion retail and real-world consumer needs, ensuring that people of all abilities can benefit from its features.
Traditional fashion platforms often lack personalized and affordability-based recommendations, leaving users with inefficient shopping experiences and increased dissatisfaction. Moreover, individuals with disabilities are frequently underserved in fashion technology, facing inaccessible interfaces and limited customization options. MIRROVIA addresses these challenges by offering a tech-driven, human-centered solution that emphasizes personalized results, efficient browsing, and universal design.
Through AR, the system captures key physical attributes such as skin tone, body shape, and figure. AI algorithms process these in conjunction with user-defined criteria—budget, occasion, and style—to generate curated product suggestions from multiple e-commerce platforms using real-time API integrations.
To support and streamline these services, MIRROVIA incorporates an AI/ML-powered supply chain backend. This system dynamically tracks product availability, price fluctuations, delivery timelines, and customer preferences across various retailers. Predictive analytics optimize stock suggestions and recommend alternatives if selected items go out of stock, enhancing fulfillment accuracy and ensuring a smooth customer experience. Retailers benefit from this real-time demand forecasting and intelligent inventory mapping, while users receive recommendations that are not only relevant but available and timely.
Accessibility lies at the heart of MIRROVIA. The app includes voice command functionality for hands-free navigation, screen reader compatibility for visually impaired users, and a simplified user interface (UI) with large, easy-to-understand icons. Personalized fit guidance supports users with prosthetics or non-standard body structures, and adaptive AI learns from user interactions to improve recommendations and accommodate accessibility needs over time.
Currently, the main focus is on refining AI-based personalization and strengthening accessibility features. However, future iterations will introduce AR-powered virtual try-ons, enabling users to see how garments fit their unique body in real-time—a feature expected to drastically reduce returns and boost satisfaction.
From a technical standpoint, MIRROVIA combines real-time AI analysis, machine learning for behavioral adaptation, dynamic product filtering, and robust API-based integrations with fashion retailers. The inclusion of an AI/ML-enhanced supply chain adds another layer of intelligence—ensuring recommendations are aligned with live market inventory, pricing trends, and logistical factors. This holistic ecosystem ensures MIRROVIA not only offers aesthetic advice but also addresses the practical considerations of availability, cost, and delivery.
In conclusion, MIRROVIA is redefining fashion-tech through the fusion of AI, AR, and inclusive design. Its real-time personalization, accessibility-first interface, and intelligent supply chain integration provide a seamless, impactful shopping experience for all users. As it evolves, MIRROVIA aims to transform the landscape of fashion retail—making style both smart and universally accessible.
